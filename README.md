This is version 2 of the README.md

#### Part 1 ####

We are going to be doing a short git team exercise.

You will need to download git on your computer if you haven't done so already.
https://git-scm.com/downloads

You will need to clone this repository. This can be done by opening your terminal,
navigating to where you want to store the files on your computer(using terminal),
and typing ```git clone https://github.com/iraleigh/git-exercise.git```

Now you should have a copy of the code from the repository.

#### Part 2 ####

If you are reading this as a local file on your computer you have already
completed the first step: cloning a repository. Congrats!

Let's get started.

You should be able to find your name below.
Go ahead and write about your favorite hobby is on the line below your name.
Once you have done this, change the version 1 at the top of this README to
version 2.

Now for the fun part.
We will use git commands to add, commit, and then push our changes to the
repository.

#### Here is a description of the commands we will use: ####

* git clone - to copy the GitHub repository on to our local machines
  * e.g. ```git clone https://github.com/iraleigh/git-exercise.git
         ```
* git add - to add our local changes to our local repository
  * e.g. ```git add .
         ```
* git commit - to save the state of our _working_ local reposity and prepare it for the GitHub repository
  * e.g. ```git commit -m "Added my bio"
         ```
* git push - to push all of our commits to the GitHub repository
  * e.g. ```git push origin master
         ```
* git pull - to get the latest changes from the GitHub repository in our local repository
  * e.g. ```git pull 
         ```

#### After we have made our changes: ####

1. First we will use
   ```git add README.md``` This tells git that we want it to keep track of the changes we made to the README

2. Next we will commit the changes using
   ```git commit -m "Type a commit message here, what did you add?"``` This makes a record of our code at this point in time if we need to refer back to it.

3. Lastly we need to push our changes to the repository so that the rest of the team
can received the changes we have made. We will use
   ```git push origin master```
