This is version 1 of the README.md

We are going to be doing a short git team exercise.

If you are reading this as a local file on your computer you have already
completed the first step: cloning a repository. Congrats!

Let's get started.

You should be able to find your name below.
Go ahead and write about your favorite hobby is on the line below your name.
Once you have done this, change the version 1 at the top of this README to
version 2.

Now for the fun part.
We will use git commands to add, commit, and then push our changes to the
repository.

#### Here is a description of the commands we will use: ####
* git clone - to copy the GitHub repository on to our local machines
  * e.g. ```git clone 
         ```
* git add - to add out local changes to our local repository
  * e.g. ```git add .
         ```
* git commit - to save the state of our _working_ local reposity and prepare it for the GitHub repository
  * e.g. ```git commit -m "Added my bio"
         ```
* git push - to push all of our commits to the GitHub repository
  * e.g. ```git push origin master
         ```
